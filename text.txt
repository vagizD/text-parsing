Natural language processing (NLP) is a specialized field for analysis and generation of human languages.
Human languages, rightly called natural language, are highly context-sensitive and often ambiguous in order to produce
a distinct meaning.
(Remember the joke where the wife asks the husband to "get a carton of milk and if they have eggs, get six," so he gets
six cartons of milk because they had eggs.) NLP provides the ability to comprehend natural language input and produce
natural language output appropriately.
